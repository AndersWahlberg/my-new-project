# Ethico – Scan for ethical impact

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Ethico is a mobile app that lets users scan a product barcode and quickly see an evidence-based “ethical risk” summary for the product and its parent company. The goal is to make responsible purchasing decisions easier in everyday shopping by combining transparent data sources with simple AI-assisted summaries.

## Background

Responsible consumption is hard in practice because relevant information is scattered across many sources and presented in inconsistent ways.

Ethico aims to solve:
* **Information overload:** ethics/sustainability data is fragmented and time-consuming to verify
* **Lack of transparency:** it’s difficult to know the parent company, supply chain risks, or controversies behind a brand
* **Decision friction in real life:** in-store decisions need to happen fast

Motivation:
* I want to support ethical consumer choices that are realistic in daily life — not “perfect”, but better informed.
* The topic matters because consumer demand can influence company behavior, but only if information is accessible and trustworthy.

## How is it used?

1. User opens the app in a grocery store or at home.
2. User scans the product’s EAN/GTIN barcode.
3. Ethico retrieves product → brand → company information.
4. The app shows:
   * a short, readable risk summary (e.g., environment, human rights, legal controversies)
   * key reasons behind the score, with timestamps
   * source links for transparency
5. Optionally, Ethico suggests alternatives in the same category.

Users and needs:
* **Everyday shoppers:** need fast, clear results and simple explanations
* **Value-driven consumers:** want deeper sources and the ability to weight categories (e.g., climate vs. labor rights)
* **Skeptical users:** need transparency, uncertainty labels, and clear source attribution
